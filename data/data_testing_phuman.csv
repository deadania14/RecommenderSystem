4004,2.5,3,nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain,20,1700
4030,2.5,2,I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.,20,1770

2071,2.5,3,"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic.",1,2625
3887,3,3,"Bought this for my mom as an upgrade to her older non-HD Kindle Fire and it is an improvement on all fronts - bigger better screen, better speakers, faster processor and updated operating system plus a slot for external storage. Great price for what you get.",20,1371

3598,3,3,"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities.

4754,3,3,Purchase was to replace Fire HD 8.9 that was left on a plane (found & return 50 days later). Like this smaller version due to size & it's 3 years newer on the technology side.,19,1632
1450,2.5,3,Easy to use. Should have bought this a long time ago.,22,1806
3429,1,1,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it.",20,3192
2975,3,3,"This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I'd recommend for people who love to read.",14,1502

4852,2.5,3,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.",17,58

3825,2.5,3,Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.,20,1990
2041,2.5,2,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.",15,3537
3831,3,3,"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card.",20,1247

1263,3,3,"I purchased it to control my lights & introduce myself to Alexa & AI, but I find myself using it for all sorts of things and enjoy using it. I can now control my front door Arlo camera by asking Alexa to show the live feed in to my TV, and get my Robots vacuum cleaner to start work , plus listen to the latest weather conditions & do my normal google search via Alexa . I am seriously hooked in to my Alexa!!!!",22,779
1639,2.5,2,"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.",15,3662
1360,3,,My wife and I enjoy using Alexa for weather information and also for the great music that we are able to access. We also have the light under the control of Alexa so that we never have to walk into a dark house again.,22,793
2025,3,,"I love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. I bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. We just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. They are quite!!! The only thing is, I wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. Some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. Overall though, I love this tablet!",18,1444

2494,3,,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife because her B&N Nook was dying. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself.",1,3664

1303,3,,"I‚Äôve been hesitant to purchase this item, didn‚Äôt feel there was an actual need. Alexa has changed my mind. I use this daily with timers and turning off appliances, checking weather and adjusting my heat. Alexa can even arm the alarm system.",22,3564
2818,2.5,,This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading,1,2364
1433,3,,I bought the echo plus that is supposed to come with a Phillips Hue light bulb. I got the echo plus but no light bulb. I contacted Elite Plus and after a very long go around was told I would get a $20 credit on the best buy gift card that I used as part of the payment. I was told it would take up to 15 days to get the credit (why so long). I was also told I would get an email stating info about the credit. I still have not gotten the email. I have my doubts if I will ever see the $20 put back on my gift card. This is the second time I have ordered a bundle from Best Buy online and have received the main item but not the bundled items. Last year I bought a friend a PS4 bundle for XMas. They got the PS4 but none of the included games. I had to call and get the games sent out separately. I don't know what is the problem is with their online ordering when bundled items are included. I am getting very wary of ordering anything online with Best Buy that I will get what I ordered on time. BTW... I really like the Echo Plus. Just not the screw up with the shipping and the initial solution I was offered when I called customer service.,22,1730
4999,3,,"this is a steal, have 8 gb model as well.This has more punch..",23,2008
1248,3,,"Saw Echo dot at my parents. Had to have one. Then I saw the plus. It was so easy to set up. Love the the music steaming. Love the light bulb that came with mine. Makes my life so much easier when I don‚Äôt have an empty hand. Guess what, I went back and bought one for my sister for Christmas. Very pleased.",22,747
1166,2.5,,The system is able to react quickly to the verbal directions. It even is able to pickup voices across the room and seems to capture the commands accurately even when spoken quickly.,22,2657
4139,3,,did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product.,20,2819

3444,3,,I was looking for a kids tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it has a kids mode on it which is really nice so he can't order or go online without permission. He loves this tablet and it's very well build .,20,460

4813,3,,"She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL",17,2401
1840,2.5,,"this is excellent for kids 3-7. the only thing I don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. I may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and I am not tech savvy. This item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids.",15,2904
1037,3,,"I have no idea how my family ever lived without these products! Since purchasing the Alexa Hub and Hue bulb, we've purchased Echo Dots for our kitchen and son's room. We absolutely love the convenience of the bulbs and Alexa is a life saver on so many levels.",22,1175

2875,3,,"I purchase 2 on Super Bowl Sunday for my 5 & 7 year old birthday. It was the perfect gift, because the 2 love their gift. The tablets was for a girl and a boy, so I purchase a pink & a blue. The tablet is very child proof.",15,682

2484,1,,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.",18,2889
2540,3,,Like it so much I gave them out as gifts for Christmas,13,251
1816,2.5,,Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better,15,2063
1298,3,,I looked at Google Home .. And the Echo. I went with the Echo after I spoke to a Best Buy employee. They helped me sort out the pros and cons. I do love all the skills that are possible. Its like another person in my apt sometimes. (I live alone) the Echo adjusts my lights and plays my Pandora. I'm pretty much loving it.,22,193
3927,3,,I bought this for my 86 year old father. he loves it. finds it very easy to use,20,2727
3651,3,,Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets,20,403

1201,2.5,,Built-in hub only lets your control Philips Hue with your voice. You still need the Philips Hue hub to be able to use the Hue app. I ended up buying the Hue hub as well. Has better speaker than the regular Echo.,22,3413
3959,2,,the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.,20,2700
3720,2.5,,Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.,20,230
3277,1,,"I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",11,144
3733,2,,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire,20,3492
1937,2,,"When I first bought it and got it started it wouldn't register my amazon account. I tried making a new account and I tried using my moms account but it would not work so I took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it was defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one works wonderfully, haven't had any issues with it yet.",13,1988

2725,2.5,,"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites.

2229,2.5,,"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great",13,199

2634,3,,"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory. It has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. Again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. It has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. Our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the CPU and GPU. It came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. It has no resource hogging GPS or RADIO but it does have bluetooth and Wi-Fi.",15,2940

It uses their version of the Android OS which they call the Fire OS which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use - Be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the Google Play store, but must rely on Amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either Apple's or Google's.",4,1528
