2,133,928,5,pos,I resisted getting this since I already have two Echo units and one Dot. Black Friday gave me reason to buy one. I LOVE IT twice as much as the regular Echo. The set up is faster and easier and I love the visuals. I use my Shopping List and To Do List A LOT and having it display and being able to edit it without logging into the app makes it so much more worth it. I may be getting another :),23,2834,5

Unfortunately, when I landed in Austria, the spring-loaded fuse door won't stay closed which is a pain to deal with. It could be a simple manufacturing random error, but as for MY experience, I was not happy to get to another country and have to immediately go out and buy an adapter when I thought I had been prepared.",39,906,-5

12,985,5003,5,pos," was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced. I'm so happy I found this tv. The smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick. I use Netflix, YouTube and I have my direct TV on here also. The picture is very clear and I got a little soundbar to go with it. Nice bang for my buck. This is a great TV for a small room.

17,542,4135,5,pos,"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it.

I picked up a second one to make use of the party mode which allows you to either sync up both speakers for true stereo seperation. Build quality is rock solid and I have no worries about bringing the Boom 2 anywhere.

44,1110,5128,5,pos,No one can have too many adapters - I can be forgetful and get to a foreign country with no way to juice up my iphone and ipad. What I like about this converter is that it has 4 USB also has the ability to plug in any USB devices. The back has pop up prongs for the different converter types. It has a high quality build and is very solid and durable. Love the travel case also,40,1003,3
45,457,2369,5,pos,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional.

51,682,4038,5,pos,"First of all, this is not an iPad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. I own an iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. If you're buying for kids, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this.

54,1041,5059,3,pos,"This is a BOSE sound quality speaker. I’ve been using it in a large family room and it is quite capable of filling the entire room with sound as promised. The issues I’ve had with this device are related with the interface between de app and the speaker and the speaker and the router. So far in about a month I’ve had to reboot the speaker 4 times because the “Alexa” functions stopped working or the WI-FI suddenly became disabled and wouldn’t reconnect. I hope that with further updates to the software this issues become resolved, but as this date I would choose another speaker if I was counting on using the AIexa functions of this device.",31,41,0

60,102,1529,5,pos,"She's becoming part of the family, but, the Echo Plus is not much different (that I have discovered, yet, anyway) than the Echo 2nd generation. I haven't had the Echo 1st generation and so I do not know. I have had the Echos (Plus, Echos-2nd generation, and Dot) about 3 weeks and the only thing I think makes the difference is that it has a better sound quality, but, we are talking for those really connoisseur kinds of ears or the ones that like to turn up the volume. The Hue lightbulbs are great. I bought the Echo Plus on a Black Friday extended Sale and the Hue lightbulb was a real bonus, further. I liked it so much I went back and bought the pack of Hue bulbs that were also on sale. We are loving the whole system and the lightbulbs.",20,899,5

63,505,2368,5,pos,"I bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my 2 youngest Grandaughters. Wanted something that would be made well, easy to use and as they get older the range of use could expand. Not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool. I will download fun and game activities but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tools. Their ages are 3 1/2 and 5 and they love them. Easy to download items, save to home screen or remove items. Their are several parental controls and options so you can feel worry free.

99,153,670,4,pos,"It can stream music really well and not just from Amazon.I was expecting it to be smart like Watson, but it is more like an Blank Stare. Amazon should look into predicting questions like during 2017 Superbowl Play Offs. Alexa was unable to display or update the Play Off Brackets. It understands my voice really well, were most telephone automated assistants rarely get what I am saying. It want pair to my Portable Bluetooth Speaker. It will pair to my cell phone, but only to receive Music from it.The Audio quality is varies with amplitude. With low amplitudes Alexa has booming sound making it hard to understand from across the room, but an amplitude setting of about 50% the audio becomes clear and understandable.
