0,2314,7,75,5,3,This is great for learning for little kids. Easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. Well made for kids in mind.
1,5032,27,433,5,0,Is full myself for watching TV
2,4735,1,3300,5,1,This is the third Fire tablet I have bought. The larger size is nice.
3,3097,11,3479,3,-1,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
4,1469,20,291,5,2,I love being able to turn my lights on or off by voice. It makes life a lot easier. I am looking forward to finish making my home a smart home by buying other products.
5,4511,1,3635,5,2,I am pleasantly surprised at how well this works. I bought the e reader and it didn't work so I was nervous buying this kindle. But it works great and my son loves it!
6,5066,33,73,5,3,"So far so good! The voice recognition is better. I don’t have to say Alexa multiple times for it to work. This one hears me everytime, the first time. The sound is much better so far."
7,1176,20,3254,5,2,This is a very neat item. Love all the things this can do!
8,2297,15,1369,4,0,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
9,2494,15,152,5,1,"Purchased this as a gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. I'm now waiting for my Nook to start acting up so that I have an excuse to get a Kindle for myself."
10,1868,8,1455,5,3,I bought this for my wife as a gift to replace her older fire. Absolutely loves it. Has all of the features she needs. I don't think there is a better tablet on the market and the value is incredible.
11,2482,2,3184,5,3,Great tablet for the kids and adults great features like the rubber case and free features for kids
12,2964,8,504,5,2,Great upgrade/replacement. No problems with it at all.
13,1545,3,583,5,3,Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable
14,1544,3,2677,5,1,just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.
15,2002,8,2932,5,2,My old kindle had no camera and was much thicker. This one has a great camera and is much slimmer.
16,2789,2,2532,5,1,Child loves it. Can be used for more than just a time killer. Can learn from it.
17,4709,1,970,4,0,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
18,3791,20,1025,5,1,I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
19,1162,20,1732,4,1,I was really reluctant buying Alexa but Ive read so much about this item that I bought the package (Alexa and Phillips bulb) and have been amazed with how well it works.
20,5028,26,429,1,0,TV is not turning on for any reason
21,1312,20,877,5,1,"As a newbie in smart home technology, I was attracted to the Echo Plus because of the built-in Zigbee hub which means it can connect directly to products like the Philips Hue line of smart bulbs without the need for a separate smart hub. Combine that with the power of Alexa voice commands and I was able to get my smart home up and running in a matter of minutes."
22,4331,1,2739,5,1,Nice Tablet for games and keeping up on social media!
23,3697,20,3321,5,0,Brought it for my son & Does EXACTLY what i want it to do.
24,3434,20,419,4,2,"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
25,4761,1,2991,1,-2,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
26,2857,7,2414,5,3,Hey we bought this for our 2 year old grandson and he loves it. Very easy to use and very durable!
27,2046,2,1691,4,2,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
28,733,23,3687,4,4,"The Show is the new Alexa Device with a video screen. I like being able to see a screen when you ask questions, and you can view videos too. I also like that you can see the temperature, and date without having to ask. I like you can view a video of a recipe, not just see text. The one item missing from this great device is the capability to hook it up to your surround audio system.I have two dots and love them. The Show would be perfect if I could also hook it up to my audio system. Even though this feature does not exist, it still is a great product."
29,4360,1,2437,4,1,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
30,2249,9,1251,4,-2,I liked my really old one a bit better. It broke after 5 years suddenly. The screen failed. I had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to Amazon. I wasn't aware of this when I first bought so it was more expensive than expected.
31,5125,40,1000,5,4,"This item is perfectly compact because you don’t need several separate international plugs (as my other units were). This takes the guess work out. I Traveled to South Africa recently and it was great! I simply inserted my usb cords into this product, slid out appropriate plug for that country, and inserted it into hotel outlet. There’s a UK, EU, etc. It worked without any issues. Throw away all those separate pieces of other adapters and just use this ONE!"
32,1953,2,578,5,2,easy to use great product and BEST BUY ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS
33,3162,11,226,4,3,"Echo sounds better for music, but Tap gives me portability. Good to have both. Now Tap is voice activated, so it's all good."
34,2970,2,1428,4,3,"Over all pretty good product.i am not so sure if it's got Bluetooth connectivity. i've had it for a few months now and kids seem to enjoy it a lot.certainly I recommend to anyone who wants to give their kids the ""best ""gift."
35,3186,11,187,5,2,"I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!"
36,3850,20,892,4,1,My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
37,4670,1,3751,5,2,"Amazon keeps getting better. Tablet now has option to move icons, set wallpaper and more. With added SD card option, is even better."
38,4582,1,2773,5,3,So easy to use super clear can't. Beat the price all around great buy
39,1538,3,2898,5,0,Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
40,929,23,1735,5,1,"Very easy to set up and use. Really like the screen to view the items searched for, and to read information about the searched item."
41,3571,20,1234,5,1,Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
42,4672,1,2592,5,1,I love my Amazon Fire tablet it does exactly what I needed to do.

44,1127,20,1921,4,0,We have two echo ourselves and purchased this as a gift for someone. We have smart plugs for our lamps that Alexa turns on/off.
45,2700,8,1918,4,2,"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
46,3264,4,667,5,0,The store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with Best Buy Program membership.
47,5041,29,442,4,1,i had tv for 10 months and lost pic and sound mfd warrenty is still in effect plus extended walmart warrenty so far mfd has had 3 mails back and forth and no tv replacement yet i do believe they will stand behind the product it seems like a good unit time will tell update coming on results
48,2470,8,3754,5,2,My son loves his kindle fire tablet. It is perfect
49,2969,7,2730,5,3,4 year old grand daughter loves it. Good size for her and easy to operate.
50,238,23,3138,3,0,Alexa show is ok same technology as a tablet except voice activated
51,5003,24,404,5,5,"was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced. I'm so happy I found this tv. The smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick. I use Netflix, YouTube and I have my direct TV on here also. The picture is very clear and I got a little soundbar to go with it. Nice bang for my buck. This is a great TV for a small room. I got the 40 for my living room and the 32 for my room. :) 32 is pictured!"
52,1551,3,3363,5,2,got this for my kindle 7 tablet . Does an excellent job charging the kindle fire 7 a lot faster than the one it came with the kindle fire
53,3009,11,2469,5,5,Love Alexa....it works so well. Speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does!
54,431,23,1241,5,4,My Echo Show is my Christmas gift to myself! So far I am having great fun with this nifty new addition to my Amazon family of home monitoring devices. I have connected the Show to my Ring doorbell.
55,2613,2,1049,5,2,My 2yr old daughter loves it! Perfect Xmas gift!
56,3664,20,1131,5,3,Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
57,634,23,3785,4,1,Nice except unlike a Google Home you cant just ask it to play music. You eventually have to purchase their music after s free trial
58,4809,13,3611,5,4,This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
59,377,23,2463,5,2,"Love the ability to video chat with grand kids, Enjoying the music everyday."
60,2185,5,591,5,1,"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
61,2087,2,693,3,0,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
62,4132,20,1911,4,2,I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips.
63,2295,8,2039,1,-4,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
64,849,23,1760,5,4,"We loved the Echo Dot, but the Show is exponentially better. Especially love to see the words of the songs being played, and views of places all over the world we want to see. Big difference in cost between dot and show, but worth it!"
65,730,23,2638,5,1,Promising product that has been getting better with software updates since release.
66,4384,1,3612,5,1,I'm an author and frequently give these away as promotional prizes. My readers love them.
67,1556,3,496,4,3,"pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand"
68,5092,37,701,5,5,"Great little product. Seems to work well so far. Nice to have so many USBs in addition to the main plug. I do see that it's a little loose in the outlet as some have said, but It stays in the wall fine with a semi-heavy adapter attached. Will give it a fill test next week in France, but so far seems great. Carrying case is a bonus."
69,2542,2,3814,5,1,This is the second one I bought. My grandkids love them.
70,123,23,2489,4,5,"Little putsy so far, but there are continuous updates that I think will make this a great device to stay connected with family. Bought a second for my dad. Who knows, he might replace his land line someday if this gets better. I do think our original Echo is a bit better at responding, but I enjoy this one in the kitchen /aka hub of the house."
71,684,23,2645,5,2,"I had looked at this for a while. I was thinking about purchasing it when Amazon was offering the buy on get the second one for less offer, but when both they and Best Buy dropped the price to $149 I jumped on it. It's perfect for my kitchen because I can use the screen to pull up recipes and I can video chat with my kids that live out of State. I would say that this is a great addition to any Smart Home."
72,2477,8,718,5,1,"We bought this for our daughter, she plays with it a lot and really loves it."
73,3995,20,1156,5,3,Very good price good item. Would purchase again. This was a gift
74,1496,20,1943,4,0,"The Echo Plus is great. Alexa is the best feature. The only problem is, you cant use it wirelessly. It must remain plugged in at all times, which is kind of annoying."
75,2661,7,1525,5,3,"My Son absolutely loves this thing, very durable and comes with a great warranty."
76,2097,8,3361,5,1,"Bought online for my granddaughter and she loves it, I have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture,"
77,2840,2,1129,5,1,I bought this for a family member with a disability. I didn't see any reviews for this purpose but so far it is working well. I felt the case would help if it was accidentally dropped.
78,4055,20,1632,5,2,Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
79,4019,20,2757,5,1,I bought this tablet for my 13 yr. old God-child and she loves it. This was her Christmas present.
80,1459,20,3601,5,2,having an assistant like Echo makes life so much easier
81,4622,1,3078,5,2,I enjoy taking photos with me and having enough videos to keep the kids entertained. On the fence go with the larger storage.
82,5051,30,9,1,-1,Save your money. It doesn’t work. Will not hold your echo
83,1806,7,2675,5,1,Limit kids usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play. A must buy for kids

85,4489,1,3300,4,1,"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
86,820,23,955,5,2,"This has been perfect for the kitchen, it plays music & I can sing along with the words on the screen. Love that Alexa also allows for multiple timer settings when cooking."
87,3294,4,1763,5,1,Wish it had its own internet connection but other than that great purchase
88,3067,11,555,5,0,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.

90,4191,20,1626,5,2,Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.
91,3457,20,2401,5,2,"We like the battery endurance. The new 8"" screen is great too."
92,386,23,1108,5,2,"Second purchase of Echo Show. Love the device and all of it's features. Used primarily for communication with my 90 yo mother. I drop in, there's nothing for her to do but talk and smile :) I use the Alexa app on my phone with mom (which works very well and still use when mobile) but I got this one for ease at home."
93,754,23,3771,5,2,Upgraded from the echo to add video support for my cameras. Sound is much better
94,2128,2,2755,5,1,Easy to use for children. Multiple color tablet covers.
95,73,19,1779,5,1,"It is still the best device for buying books and reading them. However, go with kindle paperwhite if you read books in dark places."
96,2010,2,91,5,1,"I was a slightly skeptical about giving this to my 1 year old but it has been a fantastic, durable learning tool for him and he is progressing very quick."

102,381,23,3079,5,4,My wife purchased this for me at Christmas. Was very surprised because she said she did not want a device like this in the house. I think she is enjoying it more than me. Easy to link with nest thermostat and smart plugs. Even figured out how to operate older garage door with it. If I can only figure a way for it to bring me a beer now.
103,1130,20,960,5,4,"This is our first Echo so nothing to compare it to, but so far so good! Sound is great. Fun to use and has been helpful for information needed quickly!"

109,2142,8,1827,5,1,Bought this for a gift for some one who's old tablet won't work. Just the right size to play games on.
110,4576,1,3614,5,1,Got this tablet cheap than getting the screen replaced
