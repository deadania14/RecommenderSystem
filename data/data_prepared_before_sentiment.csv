0,1,1,2,1,I thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. I think it is too small to read on it... not very comfortable as regular Kindle. Would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.
1,1,2,3,3,This kindle is light and easy to use especially at the beach!!!
2,1,3,2.5,2,"Didnt know how much i'd use a kindle so went for the lower end. im happy with it, even if its a little dark"
3,1,4,3,3,"I am 100 happy with my purchase. I caught it on sale at a really good price. I am normally a real book person, but I have a 1 year old who loves ripping up pages. The Kindle prevents that, it's extremely portable (it fits better in my purse than a giant book), and I have it loaded with lots of books. I finish one and start another, without having to go store. It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit. A simple book light from the Dollar tree solves that issue. This is my second Kindle (the first being the old Keyboard model, which I put down because I fell out of love with the keyboard. Lol) and it most likely won't be my last."
4,1,5,3,3,Solid entry level Kindle. Great for kids. Gifted for a kid of my friend and they love to use it to read more than their iPads. battery is good but higher model is a bit better.
5,1,6,3,3,This make an excellent ebook reader. Don't expect much from this device except to read basic ebooks. The good thing is it's cheap and good to read in the sun.
6,1,7,3,3,"I ordered this for my daughter, as I have the black paperwhite, and I love it. I read quite a bit and the larger books were driving me crazy having to hold them up while laying down, or wanting to take a book on vacation and lugging around a thick paperback, with this I can throw it in my bag and read anywhere. Its light weight, easy to use, the battery life lasts for weeks, which makes it an all around awesome device. My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school! You can also download your own public library app (if your county offers that) and read free from there as well. You can shop for e-books straight from the device through Amazon.com."
7,1,8,2.5,1,I bought my Kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
8,1,9,3,3,"amazon kindle is always the best ebook, upgrade every new model"
9,1,10,3,3,"It's beyond my expectation, and it can even show music score. Not fast turning though."
10,1,11,3,3,If you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. It really is lightweight and highly functional. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. The only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. Overall an excellent buy.
11,2,12,3,3,Great Gift for anyone. Very easy to setup. Coexist with all IOT Devices. Alexa is AWESOME!
12,2,13,3,3,Super excited to give this as a gift. It's super convenient that Best Buy has Echo products in store instead of having to purchase from Amazon.
13,2,14,3,3,"We bought this for mother in law, buying another for me."
14,2,15,3,3,"Well designed, good sound, has everything Alexa has plus the HD video. Always ready with answers with associated video or text if applicable. Can show movie trailers, can also watch Amazon video. Excellent on-demand security video with Amazon compatible cameras. Voice activated message and/or video calls to Amazon Show owners or Alexa App holders. Highly recommended."
15,2,16,3,3,I have one Alexa and three Echo dots and having Echo Show now is awesome!
16,2,17,3,3,Omg I love my amazon show it is sooo cool and does a lot of cool stuff
17,2,18,3,3,Great looking design. Amazon Echo Show was easy to set up and use.
18,2,19,3,3,The product is very entertaining and useful. Would recommend it to anyone.
19,2,20,2.5,2,Got it for few weeks but it kind of fades away from your life.
20,2,21,2.5,3,This device is awesome ‚Äò really lets you get very excited about smart home technology ‚Äò I‚Äôm buying a second one for my upstairs
21,2,22,2.5,3,Overall product is excellent. Speakers should have a capability to be used as Bluetooth speakers like the echo.
22,3,23,3,3,A lazy mans drean when it is combined with Alexa. If you get the harmony hub you can really impress with home automation
23,3,24,3,3,I really enjoy my Fire stick. It's really easy to use.
24,3,25,3,3,Really cool device! Instantly noticed the difference in quality when I switched from the regular Fire Stick to the Fire TV with 4k.
25,3,26,3,3,Love it! Works great. One in each of the main rooms.
26,4,27,3,3,Works great. Turns H&A up and down. Tv on and off. Lights on and off. All from Alexa. You do have to have apps and special lights.
27,4,28,3,3,I LOVE Alexa and my Echo device (and Smart Bulb) so much I bought 4 more Echos and 8 more bulbs with more to come soon...
28,4,29,3,3,"So I went to the store, purchased and gifted.it was a snap."
29,4,30,3,3,"Love the convenience of being able to turn on a light or other appliances connected to smart switches with voice commands. Also very convenient music streaming, news and weather reports."
30,4,31,3,3,"We replaced our old echo for this one with a smart hub, works great"
31,4,32,3,3,Speaker was used as a giveaway and everyone wanted it! It was a huge hit at our conference. Would buy again.
32,4,33,3,3,I bought this for my moms birthday and she loves it.
33,4,34,3,3,I like this smart machine and will recommend to my friends
34,4,35,3,3,"purchased this product while was on sale, very easy to pair, looks well made, very happy with it."
35,4,36,3,3,Love it. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. Great speakers too provides a lot of great information and fun too!
36,4,37,3,3,"Really enjoying this device so far,,,my smart phone is basic Tracfone...currently adding smart lighting...will probably switch to a tablet for controlling and adding to a future (limited) smart home"
37,5,38,3,3,I needed a second charger (for traveling) for my Kindle Fire that was a fast charger. This worked great. It charges my Kindle fire in just a few hours.
38,5,39,3,3,This solved the problem of my daughter's lost kindle charger.
39,5,40,3,3,I found that I was immediately sked by a staff member if I needed help. I received good advice and shown similar alternative products. What I bought was perfect for what I wanted. The price was quite reasonable.
40,5,41,3,3,Best kindle charger ever. Took 30 minutes to being my kindle back to life.
41,5,42,3,3,Great product for quickly charging your Kindle!!!!
42,5,43,2,3,I bought this because the package said it was a fast charger only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/
43,5,44,3,3,"Tried different charging blocks, nothing worked properly. Plugged in the Amazon block, Kindle came right up."
44,5,45,3,3,Quickly charges kindle so son can use it. Worked great right out of the package
45,5,46,3,3,just bought. seems to be working great so far. not sure how long it will last.
46,5,47,3,3,Good one and working without any issues. Slim and portable
47,5,48,3,3,"This works well, charges book readers quickly and easily"
48,6,49,2.5,3,Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
49,6,50,3,3,"My daughter (4) she loves it. Easy to navigate, hard to break."
50,6,51,2.5,3,Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
51,6,52,3,3,I bought two tablets for you little ones and they love them. I would recommend.
52,6,53,2,2,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
53,6,54,3,3,This is the best tablet I've ever purchased. The screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my 5 year old loves it makes me jealous and want to get a kindle but that's ok I can use parent most while he's sleeping. All over a really good tablet for both parent and child
54,6,55,3,3,Got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.
55,8,56,3,3,I've had kindles for years and this latest one is also right up at the top
56,6,57,3,3,Bought this for my six year old grandson. The set up was very easy. He is able to download kids only stuff and can send us videos of himself using the app. He just loves it. Truly kid friendly.
57,8,58,3,3,It has a great camera and I really enjoy my games and Facebook on this larger screen than my phone. I love not using my data up on my phone.
58,6,59,3,3,"Got this for my 18 month old son so that he can watch movies on our trip to LA and he loved it. Lots of games, apps and much more. Still learning more features about this product and we love it too."
59,7,60,3,3,My husband loves this Kindle. He has a muscular disease keeping him from being able to handle anything with much weight at all. This is perfect.
60,6,61,3,3,My son is 3 and he loves it so easy to use. It's great.
61,9,62,1,1,"Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas."
62,8,63,3,3,"For the money I highly recommended it. It is great when linked to Netflix, Disney Movies, etc"
63,9,64,3,3,"I got this for my daughter, she enjoy playing this"
64,6,65,1,1,"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too."
65,7,66,2.5,3,"UI is not smooth, it flickers sometimes. Overall a thumbs up from me"
66,9,67,3,3,My son love it. He watch his favorite cartoon shows and love to read books
67,8,68,3,3,I am using it for my 3 year old and she loves it..
68,9,69,3,3,Great for little kids who have a problem with breaking stuff.
69,6,70,3,3,This is great product. The tablet are made tough and great price.
70,9,71,3,3,"My 3 and 2 year old download their own games.Easy to set up and get working. Thanks to parental Control, I know what they are downloading"
71,8,72,3,3,"I got this for my mother as a gift. She absolutely loves it. She was wanting a small, cheap tablet and this fit her needs."
72,8,73,3,3,"Gave it to my grandkids (ages 3, 4 & 9) for Christmas and they loved it."
73,9,74,3,3,This is my 2yr. olds and he loves it. He loves the different games and watching reviews.
74,7,75,2.5,3,My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
75,8,76,2,2,Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
76,7,77,3,3,"I replaced my kindle that I had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that I was reading before I bought the new kindle. I am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. I did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. I will enjoy this kindle for years to come"
77,8,78,3,3,"bought this kindle for my grandson, he loves it and it very easy to use"
78,8,79,3,3,My son just love playing games on this tablet. Its easy and fun!
79,9,80,3,3,I highly recommend this product for children with special needs
80,7,81,2.5,2,Had problem with cutting off device. Good easy read
81,7,82,3,3,Love my kindle ! I enjoy reading everyday and I can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .
82,8,83,2.5,3,"Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick."
83,8,84,3,3,My granddaughter loved it. She used it for her school work.
84,10,85,2.5,3,I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
85,9,86,3,3,"We got this for our nephew and he absolutely loves it, very easy for him to use too."
86,7,87,2.5,3,"This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'Goggle' info on her phone."
87,9,88,2.5,3,"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
88,7,89,2.5,3,"Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes and you can adjust the size of the font. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale"
89,7,90,2.5,3,I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.
90,9,91,3,3,My child loves her tablet and I love it. It keeps her busy with learning games and books
91,9,92,2.5,3,Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
92,10,93,3,3,for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it
93,11,94,2.5,3,Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
94,7,95,3,3,Exactly what I was looking for size wise and functional.
95,11,96,3,3,I had one of the first Kindle fires for years and I loved it. So I wanted another newer one and it's great! Has a good battery.
96,10,97,2.5,3,"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
97,11,98,2.5,3,Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
98,11,99,1,1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
99,11,100,3,3,"This is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsung/verizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster."
100,10,101,2.5,3,Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
101,11,102,2.5,3,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
102,11,103,2.5,3,Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
103,10,104,3,3,"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
104,11,105,3,3,"Love this Kindle. There are to many apps and games offered for download. Love the book selection Easy to navigate The charger seems a bit loose, though"
105,10,106,2.5,3,"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
106,11,107,3,3,Bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! Definitely recommend!
107,10,108,3,3,I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.
108,10,109,3,3,The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
109,11,110,3,3,I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet.
110,10,111,3,3,"this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse"
111,10,112,2.5,3,This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
112,10,113,2.5,3,I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.
113,12,114,3,3,"Bought the echo first, and liked it so much I bought a Tap to add mobility. I carry it around all the time, to the garage, working out, etc."
114,12,115,3,3,My teenager loves this and uses it daily. We've also took it places with us and the sound is great.
115,12,116,3,3,Plays all my iPod music via Bluetooth. Also plays radio stations you can't get on a regular radio. Very practical and fun.
116,12,117,1.5,1,Not too satisfied with the sound and it loses Bluetooth connection no matter what phone I use (either Iphone or Android).
117,12,118,3,3,Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound
118,12,119,3,3,I love it it does everything I want can't believe how great it is
119,12,120,3,3,"I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists. I picked the Tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio, and can be recharged overnight."
120,12,121,2,2,"Alexa works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up."
121,12,122,3,3,"I bought this about a month ago and I really like it. The best part is light in weight, sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it comes with Batterey charger. The voice command activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radios from TuneIn."
122,12,123,2.5,3,Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.
123,12,124,3,3,Bought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!
124,13,125,3,3,I was initially going to just get the Amazon Kindle but I thought this gives me a tablet and a easy way to read books. I buy e-college texts. It has helped me so much!! I'm so happy I invested my money in this.
125,13,126,3,3,"This was an Xmas gift for my wife. She had wanted a pad of some sort but I just couldn't afford an Ipad so I looked at the Fire as an alternative. First the screen size was just what I wanted. Second the price was very reasonable. Third it had functions and capabilities that were suitable for my wife's skills and needs. She absolutely loves it and I actually got a compliment on my present giving. That don't happen very often let me tell you. I will recommend this she's pleased I'm pleased what else do you need? My son was able to piggyback off of this gift, and purchased her the cover to go with it. So it really worked for my family. And I made my wife happy ."
126,13,127,3,3,"Bought an IPad and didn't like it. Returned it and got the Fire 10.1. This is my third Fire, love it....no.learning curve."
127,13,128,2.5,3,Love the bigger screen but do think this Fire HD 10TH runs a little slow. My last Fire HD was not as slow.
128,13,129,3,3,I love my original Kindle Fire but the size and features on the latest Kindle are a plus
129,13,130,3,3,Very satisfied. Use it daily while watching TV and other activites
130,14,131,3,3,"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have."
131,13,132,3,3,"Love the tablet, not only for reading (upgrade from Kindle) but for searching the Internet, email, etc. And I can take it anywhere. Cheaper than an iPAD and does enough for what I need."
132,13,133,3,3,"This tablet is certainly large which makes it cumbersome when reading in a reclining position. However, its terrific for reading or watching films on a plane, desk or otherwise sitting up."
133,13,134,3,3,"Excellent value priced 10"" tablet. To bad Amazon killed it. I purchased it as a gift for my wife and she loves the size and quality of the display."
134,13,135,2.5,3,Just writing this review to get my points...This was a gift for my mother. I think she likes it fine.
135,14,136,3,3,"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)"
136,13,137,2.5,3,"I got the amazon Fire HD 10 for reading and other activities. It was very easy to set up. Netflix worked ok on it. It mostly works well, but there are limitations to the apps that are available. I tried it out for a while and then returned it for a Samsung S2 9.7."
137,14,138,2.5,3,Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.
138,14,139,3,3,The new Kindle is a great gift and fantastic entertainment idea.
139,14,140,3,3,This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
140,14,141,3,3,Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.
141,14,142,1,1,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with
142,14,143,3,3,Almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. Easy to carry around. Great on eyes and reading is enjoyable
143,14,144,2.5,3,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
144,14,145,3,3,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
145,14,146,3,3,I like this so much more than the Voyage. The shape makes for easier holding. I only wish this devise was maybe 2 inches taller then it would look like a real book
146,15,147,3,3,"I had an older version of a Kindle e-reader that allowed me to download books on the go, but I felt like something was missing. Several upgrades later, I got this for a gift, and I think it basically includes everything that was missing. It is so lightweight and compact that I can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand. It has backlighting that doesn't disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting- it's just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths. It can self-adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day."
147,15,148,3,3,"so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one...."
148,15,149,2.5,3,"Excellent Ereader if that is all you are looking for. Probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the Voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality."
149,15,150,2.5,3,"I have an old Kindle Touch, the last one that still had text-to-voice, which no longer works. I decided to upgrade, started reading the reviews, was enticed by the The Kindle Voyage and took the plunge. The Voyage is pretty and sleek, with neat features, and I enjoyed using it for a few days, but my frugal self just couldn't justify the price difference between it and the PaperWhite. While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the ""page turn"" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I'm in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy. However, it's only when they're compared side-to-side that I wished I wasn't so cost conscious. If money is not an object, I'd say get the Kindle Voyage, if it is, the Paperwhite is a fine little reader, and overall I'm happy I have it."
150,15,151,3,3,this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired - worth upgrading your older version kindle...
151,15,152,2.5,3,"Definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the LCD screens of smart phones and tablets. The only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our WiFi network and then won't connect to the Kindle store. I don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this."
152,15,153,2,3,Have had it for a while noe. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.
153,15,154,3,3,"I am extremely happy with my new Kindle Voyage. The text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the Kindle Paperwhite. The device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, The adaptive front light works great. I have an iPad with the Kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my Kindle Voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit."
154,15,155,2,3,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly."
155,15,156,3,3,"Even though it is a little pricy, I like my new Kindle Voyage. It looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen - no buttons. It is lightweight. You can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. It is automatically adjusts to different light conditions."
156,15,157,2.5,3,The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.
157,16,158,2.5,3,"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
158,16,159,3,3,outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
159,16,160,3,3,This is a great tablet for the price. I have one that I purchased a few years ago and use it much more than my laptop. Recently purchased two more for gifts.
160,16,161,2.5,3,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
161,16,162,3,3,"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!"
162,16,163,1,1,"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
163,16,164,3,3,I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
164,16,165,2.5,3,"I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads."
165,16,166,3,3,I got this kindle because I broke my Fire 7'. It took some getting use to since the screen was bigger but overall it was a great purchase.
166,16,167,3,3,"This 8"" tablet is much better than the older 7"" tablet. It is faster and have a camera. Great improvement over the older version."
167,16,168,2.5,3,"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
168,17,169,3,3,This tablet is perfect for travel! Recently took it on a trip and the battery lasted the entire day with watching shows on and off on Netflix. Great first tablet!
169,17,28,2.5,3,"Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
170,17,170,1.5,1,I can't update Facebook and a few other apps. It's not what I expected.
171,17,171,2.5,3,It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
172,17,172,3,3,"This is just perfect for my 7 year old nothing fancy, parental control is a bit confusing but i got it now, the case is perfect to keep it.safe just get a sd card for extra memory"
173,17,173,3,3,I love my new Amazon Fire tablet it's great!! The perfect size to fit in my purse so that I can take it with me. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
174,17,174,3,3,I upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet. Works great and does everything I need it to do.
175,17,175,3,3,Bought if for my 6 year old son. Has plenty of space. Long battery life. It's durable and hasn't broke when dropped (I'm going to buy a case though!!!)
176,17,160,3,3,I love this tablet.It is very efficient and easy to use.
177,17,176,3,3,I would highly recommend the Kindle Fire. For a first time user it was really very easy to learn to navigate.
178,17,177,3,3,Great on the go companion for avid reader. Easy to load books and connect with prime.
179,18,178,3,1,i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd
180,18,179,3,3,This is a fantastic product for reading books. It is wonderful to use in full sunshine. I have a kindle fire so I thought this would be unnecessary now I am wishing I had purchased it sooner. The much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire.
181,18,180,3,3,"Fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. I like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands."
182,18,181,3,3,"Pricey? Yes... For serious readers and users of library e-books, completly worth it. While nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or Amazon on the fly... Never have to seek out light to read by (a noticeable improvement in the backlight), exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses... Great battery life... Great build quality... I expect it to last a long time... Only upgraded as I lost my last kindle on the train."
183,18,182,2.5,3,"This is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the Paperwhite. The auto-brightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. The new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.The power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. The backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen Paperwhite.The only issue I have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, I have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. And of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the Paperwhite."
184,18,183,2.5,2,"I purchase this for my wife; it work well but I think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light"
185,18,184,3,3,The Kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. Her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. She loves both products and couldn't be happier with the products.
186,18,185,3,3,I wanted this when I first heard about it. My husband surprised me for my birthday. It was the best gift. Love Love it
187,18,186,3,3,Very happy and satisfiedEasier to handle. Fast charging
188,18,187,3,3,"It is easy to use and have a huge selection of books, I recomend it"
189,18,188,3,3,The Kindle Voyage is definitely the way to go. I bought this Kindle to replace my 1st generation Kindle because I wanted a more compact model and the 3G capability this one offers. I am definitely a fan!
190,19,189,2.5,3,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
191,19,190,2.5,3,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
192,19,191,3,3,Very sleek design and very easy to use - nice graphics!!!
193,19,192,2.5,3,Bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
194,19,193,3,3,It was easy to set up and use. Best Buy employees were a huge help teaching me about the many features.
195,19,194,3,3,My grandkids play on my smaller one. Thought I better get a back up for me.
196,19,195,3,3,Fantastic tablet fire one is great. Small and portable
197,19,196,3,3,"Gets use everyday by my girlfriend who i bought it for with no complaints, also love the color. Also may get one for myself."
198,19,197,3,3,"This has replaced my laptop for out and about. Easy to use. In addition, I can now read e books and listen to audio books. So convenient....."
199,19,198,3,3,Purchased for my son who loves to read books. Saw him watching old TV show. He sat down with me and showed me what all it could do. Who would figure. I thought it was just for reading books. Now I want one too!
200,19,36,3,3,I bought this as an affordable alternative to the iPad mini. I liked the expandable storage option and size. Super easy to use. Unfortunately granddaughter wanted and iPad mini to go with her other apple products. So I ended up returning it. In hindsight I should've kept it for myself.
201,19,199,3,3,this is my second one and must have one of these at all times
202,20,200,3,3,BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
203,20,140,3,3,This is the best kindle ereader yet. The size and weight make it perfect for comfortable reading. You will find yourself reading more books than ever with it.
204,20,201,3,3,"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read."
205,20,146,3,3,The thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and PW. very fast and responsive. I wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a CD case
206,20,202,3,3,Great ebook for a beginner. Light and good looking
207,20,203,3,3,"This was a gift for my friend. My friend likes it, I wouldn't buy something like this for this much money. The screen is small."
208,20,145,3,3,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though"
209,20,31,3,3,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)"
210,20,204,3,3,"I own a Kindle HDX 8.9 and wanted something small and portable... WOW is all I can say when I got my hands on the Kindle Oasis ( Thank you Babes :) ). The Kindle Oasis is very tiny, portable & fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! The clarity of the screen is awesome. The touch of it works perfect! Very different than my HDX BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it! A little more pricey than the paperwhite BUT this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading & the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! Keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red (red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color) it's beautiful! Picture shows My Kindle Oasis in the middle of the IPhone 7 Plus (left) & Samsung S8+ (right) so you can get an idea on the size... it's super cute! It's tinier than the Kindle paperwhite!"
211,20,205,3,3,Upgraded from my old Kindle keyboard. I love the ability to adjust brightness and font. I have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. I was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. The charging cover last a long time. I wish there were more colors to choose from.
212,20,138,2.5,3,Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.
213,20,141,3,3,Very nice Kindle with a great Battery life. My old kindle was not able to upgrade so I got the new Kindle and very pleased with the product. Arrived as promised from BESTBUY.COM.
214,21,206,3,3,I have had this for several weeks. It works great. I am very satisfied with it so far.
215,21,207,3,3,Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
216,21,115,3,3,My mom loves the kindle fire hd 8. She had the first kindle and it was time for an upgrade! Great buy for her birthday present!!
217,21,208,3,3,"If you love Amazon, you'll love the Kindle HD8. It's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. For less than $100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!"
218,21,209,3,3,This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
219,22,210,2.5,3,Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
220,21,211,2,1,meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
221,22,212,3,3,This was a Christmas present. The person that received it was very happy with it.. She has other Kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous ones.
222,22,213,3,3,This is my second Fire. Wanted a larger size to make eBooks easier to read. Very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. Easy to take along in a tote. Perfect for what I wanted it for.
223,22,207,3,3,Purchased this for a gift for my mother who is a amazon fanatic she loves it ! Made her christmas this year
224,22,214,3,2,Only negative is the apps. Thought they were from android but they're an Amazon version and limited.
225,21,215,3,3,"I bought this kindle for my 11yr old granddaughter for Christmas. Me and my husband both had kindles several years prior, and she and my 6 year old grandson love watching and playing on them. Both children have all kinds of game systems but use the kindle way more. My 6 yr old grandson still plays with mine and loves watching you tube, videos and playing games on it. He has several game systems, Xbox, sega, ds but still uses my kindle all the time over those systems.my husband used his all the time for everything from internet to watching movies and shows. I'm getting ready to buy my grandson a new kindle( mine is a bit older and has cracked screen now but still works good).He would like one to call his own. I'm looking at a 16 GB or 32 GB.they are really durable and tough."
226,21,100,3,3,"She loves it, the only problem I have is getting it away from her, even while riding in vehicles. LOL"
227,21,210,2.5,3,Video quality is very good. Works well with Amazon Prime Video and Music - no surprises there. Apps are VERY disappointing - many common apps are not available - even though there are Android versions! Not bad if you have modest expectations.
228,21,216,3,3,This is my 2nd tablet. Kindle Fire hd 8 reviewed throughly elsewhere many times for its solid performance for money. I mainly wanna talk about excellent buying experience at local best buy. It was not in Stock but employee we extra miles to locate the stock somewhe re but I like my local store much so ended up ordering there. Keep up the good work !. Very pleasant buying experience.
229,22,217,2.5,3,This is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading
230,21,218,3,3,Easy to use. Very lightweight. Would recommend to anyone
231,22,219,3,3,"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started."
232,21,220,2.5,3,Nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! Affordable! Charging battery can be frustrating at time. Normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. It is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.
233,22,189,2.5,3,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."

235,22,221,3,3,Had a prob with original one I purchased and Bedt Buy replaced it hassle free
236,22,110,3,3,I love the tablets HD picture is beautiful. The fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use. Great tablet.
237,22,222,3,3,I talk myself into the 32g and I am so glad I did!!! I have used only kindles for the past 5 years and I love them.... I love the color as well!!!
238,23,223,2.5,3,"Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
239,23,224,3,3,My sister in-law recommended these to my wife and I and I thought I would try one. They are just the right size to lay in bed of a evening and read a good book for a while.
240,23,225,3,3,My son uses this tablet for movies and music and to surf the internet. For the money it has been fantastic.
241,23,226,3,3,A friend recommended the tablet and I am happy with it.
242,23,227,3,3,"The product was for my daughter, she loves it, and plays with it all of the time."
243,23,228,1.5,1,The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
244,23,229,2.5,2,was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
245,23,230,2.5,3,Great product. Great price. I'm reading more since I started using a Kindle.
246,23,231,3,3,Great product. Exactly what I've come to expect from my Kindle readers.
247,23,232,3,3,For those that have Prime this is almost a must have. Keeps all your Amazon stuff in one place.
248,23,233,3,3,Using for Pandora in an office setting. Set up with older system and speaker system - works great.
249,23,234,3,3,Great tablet for the money so cheap that I use it for a stand alone interface for my fish tank
