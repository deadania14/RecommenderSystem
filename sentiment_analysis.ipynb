It serves all my needs. I picked this one over the Paperwhite because the price was unbeatable and the only difference that I could see was this one wasn't backlit.

My daughter is in public school and they offer an online library for E-Readers, so she can now download books for free from school!

That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.',\n",

While the ambient light sensor was nice, I often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. I made more errors of turning a page than I meant to with the \"page turn\" because of where the page turn spots are located, plus, I\\'m in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet, so I kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. However, the clarity of the screen, the quality of the light, the form factor, the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. Nonetheless, the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the Paperwhite. The thing I miss most about the Voyage is the quality of the light, and how even the lighting is on it. The unit I had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page, or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the Voyage. I purchased the newest model of the Paperwhite and I like it, but the lighting appears pretty dingy.

       " 'even when i‚äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book i‚äôm reading are still crystal clear. that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost me.the kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book i choose instantly opens, ready to be read.it is the perfect size and isn‚äôt heavy or bulky. i really do read for hours at a time. sometimes i pace the floor while i read. sometimes i‚äôm on my elliptical machine when i read. and sometimes i‚äôm sitting down. no matter what i‚äôm doing, the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.when i receive a book that is in pdf, most of the time i can enlarge the words. if it won‚äôt allow me to enlarge the words, i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. i am able to make notes on the book if needed, and i can highlight words and/or passages.my merlot leather cover is attractive. when i flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.how to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page, it says that its ‚äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚äù this was a huge thing for me. instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, i would be able to read for months without charging the kindle!is this how my oasis has performed? well, not so much. there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two months.first, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. that one is impossible for me. there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚äôt occur very often. my kindle goes everywhere with me, and i use just about every spare moment to read.second, the wireless needs to be turned off. that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.third, this is based on your light setting at 10. that is way too low for me. i keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.i don‚äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. my light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and i put my kindle to sleep the second i‚äôm done reading. so how long does a single charge last me? ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off. once i succeed in keeping my wireless off, i will let you know how long the charge lasts.now, i don‚äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. i allow it to drain down to about 50% before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to charge.the one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white. for some reason, i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. but since i bought the oasis to read books on, color isn‚äôt needed.special offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up. they aren‚äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. you can pay a higher price so they won‚äôt appear on your kindle if you would rather not see them.i asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked. if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldn‚äôt last for months, would i still have bought it? yes, i would have. if i had known that everything would appear in black and white, would i still have bought it? yes, i would have.',\n",

       " 'i have an old kindle touch the last one that still had text to voice which no longer works. i decided to upgrade started reading the reviews was enticed by the the kindle voyage and took the plunge. the voyage is pretty and sleek with neat features and i enjoyed using it for a few days but my frugal self just couldnt justify the price difference between it and the paperwhite. while the ambient light sensor was nice i often ended up just adjusting it manually because it was still a little bright in a completely dark room. i made more errors of turning a page than i meant to with the page turn because of where the page turn spots are located plus im in the habit of flipping pages on the phone or a tablet so i kept swiping despite the availability of page turn. however the clarity of the screen the quality of the light the form factor the weight and the way it felt in my hand while reading were all very nice. nonetheless the price difference bothered me enough to return it and get the paperwhite. the thing i miss most about the voyage is the quality of the light and how even the lighting is on it. the unit i had did not have blank spots or a yellowish top half of the page or any of the lighting issues some reviewers mentioned with the voyage. i purchased the newest model of the paperwhite and i like it but the lighting appears pretty dingy. however its only when theyre compared side to side that i wished i wasnt so cost conscious. if money is not an object id say get the kindle voyage if it is the paperwhite is a fine little reader and overall im happy i have it.',\n",
