       " 'the tv is excellent and weighs about 10 lbs you have to register it using a code i tried doing so with my phone but it didnt work so i called a number on the registering app  turns out i must have entered the website wrong and then dialed a scam number this guy told me i needed to pay 99 to register the tv i said not a chance bozo ill read the manual and send it back if i have to pay anything else with the tv i called the number in the manual and the woman said there is no cost to register the tv and that the first number must have been a scam',\n",
       " 'this tv had no picture i think it was from the screen having a huge crack in it yes i am sure thats it i think one feature that it lacks is some sort of protection before i opened it but i cant talk about that per amazons rules yet having an adequate cushion is very important very disappointed i love my other roku tvs from tcl but this one was doomed tcl should rework this feature',\n",
       " 'i got 3 of these 40 tvs for the bedrooms at 199 plus tax and i am very pleased with them great picture easy set up and an over all great value they do have roku built in so you do have to go thru some steps at rokucomlink to set up your roku account if you already have an account its even easier there was no problem connecting to my wifi and navigating with the remote is pretty simple',\n",
       " ' was looking for something nice for my room that was reasonably priced im so happy i found this tv the smart portion is very easy to use and the setup took about 20 min fairly quick i use netflix youtube and i have my direct tv on here also the picture is very clear and i got a little soundbar to go with it nice bang for my buck this is a great tv for a small room i got the 40 for my living room and the 32 for my room  32 is pictured',\n",
       " 'do not buy this tv its not worth it it doesnt connect to wifi and if it does everytime it is turned on youll have to re connect it yourself or wait an hour for it to auto connect now remember this is if you can get it to connect at all when you call the makers of the tv on their support line their 1 and only solution was to unplug the tv and plug it back in awful customer service awful product awful everything dont waste your money buy from a better brand even at 200 its not worth it because for them to call it a smart tv is false im sending it back in getting my money back',\n",
       " 'a nightmare to active tv  as soon as i went to the website to activate tv my phone blew up with people saying i can help you active  but you must create an account first so i did and could not complete activation until i provided my credit card needless to say i did not provide that and 2 hours later finally tv was activated obvious i was being scammed because it does not cost anything to activate beware of scammers from roku',\n",

       " 'beyond disappointing purchased this tv solely to have linked to my echo for the hands free voice control it works for about 30 minutes and then will proceed to tell me it doesnt support that ive run the gamut of factory reset un plug un link etc nothing works and amazon customer service has no fix for me i feel like i wasted my money so to you i say save your money and buy a better quality smart tv for the same price i will change this review if they ever fix this and decide to help me',\n",
       " 'perfect size for my kitchen wall and with a swing arm i can turn it and watch cooking shows from the kitchen island very happy with the tv and set up',\n",

       " 'so wanted just a cute little tv for my room and this size is perfect love the remote i can do alexa or just go straight to netflix has options for cable and hdmi i really only use it for netflixspotify and hbo only downfall is that sometimes on hulu or hbo it will lose sound or just randomly go back to the home screen which is a tad annoying but besides that sounds good and picture is amazing worth it for me',\n",
       " 'i didnt even turn the tv on once i unpacked it i realized it had holes for a 100x200 vesa mount however my wall mount doesnt support that given that my wall mount is more expensive than the tv im returning the tv my mistake i should have checked first',\n",
       " 'so far so good i bought this from my son to be used a video game tv for his bedroom so far no complaints from him setting it up was a chore we are cord cutters so there isn’t any cable boxes to hook up but i did have a lot of apps to sign into to that took some time 😁 it took me sometime to figure out how to get to the actual app store and not just featured apps and some of the games are very expensive for an app 15 for final fantasy most games average 3 or 5 the picture quality and sound are fine for a bedroom tv i wouldn’t recommend it for a main room tv unless you plan on using a sound bar i have his tv set at 30 for volume and it’s not too loud i only paid 100 for this tv and to me that was a heck of a bargain he is happy and that makes me happy 😊i paid 4 i believe for a 4 year warranty so this tv should last awhile',\n",
       " 'i give it 3 stars because i didnt like how it was exposed at my front door it wasnt covered so everybody knew it was a tv i also didnt like the smell it still smells like battery i had to open my doors and windows because it was so strong but other than that i really like it',\n",
